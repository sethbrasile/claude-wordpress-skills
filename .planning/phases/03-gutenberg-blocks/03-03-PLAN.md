<objective>
Create the two slash commands for the block development skill -- /wp-block-review (full review) and /wp-block (quick scan).

Purpose: Slash commands are the user-facing entry points. They delegate to the SKILL.md workflow (full review) or grep patterns (quick scan), matching the exact pattern established by the security, performance, and plugin skills.

Output: 2 markdown files in `commands/` (~10-15 lines each).

  <name>Task 1: Create /wp-block-review and /wp-block slash commands</name>
  <files>
    commands/wp-block-review.md
    commands/wp-block.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create both slash command files by following the EXACT pattern of the existing security and plugin skill commands (`commands/wp-sec-review.md`, `commands/wp-sec.md`, `commands/wp-plugin-review.md`, `commands/wp-plugin.md`). These are simple delegation files.

**File 1: commands/wp-block-review.md (BLK-29)**

Mirror the existing review commands exactly, replacing with block development content:

```markdown
---
description: WordPress block development review - validates block.json schema, editor components (React/JSX), server-side rendering, block deprecations, InnerBlocks patterns, and Interactivity API usage for WP 6.5+
argument-hint: [file-or-directory]
---

Use and follow the **wp-block-development** skill to perform a comprehensive WordPress block development review.

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use current working directory)

Execute the full Code Review Workflow from the skill, load reference files as needed for deeper analysis, and format output using the skill's Output Format section with severity levels (Critical/Warning/Info). Review both PHP and JavaScript/JSX files. If security concerns are found, suggest running `/wp-sec-review`. If plugin architecture issues are found, suggest running `/wp-plugin-review`.
```

**File 2: commands/wp-block.md (BLK-30)**

Mirror the existing quick scan commands exactly, replacing with block development content:

```markdown
---
description: Quick WordPress block scan - fast pattern detection for block.json issues, missing useBlockProps, deprecated APIs, and render callback problems across PHP and JS/JSX files
argument-hint: [path]
---

Use the **wp-block-development** skill to perform a quick block development check.

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use current working directory)

Focus only on the "Search Patterns for Quick Detection" section -- run the grep commands to find block development issues fast across both PHP and JavaScript/JSX files. Report matches with file:line references and severity levels. Skip deep analysis.

If critical issues are found, suggest running `/wp-block-review` for comprehensive block review with fix recommendations.
```

**Key differences from plugin/security commands:**
- Description references block.json, editor components, render callbacks, Interactivity API
- wp-block-review mentions suggesting both /wp-sec-review and /wp-plugin-review for cross-cutting concerns
- wp-block mentions scanning both PHP and JS/JSX files (first command to do this)
- wp-block suggests /wp-block-review (not other skills) for follow-up
- Otherwise identical structure and delegation pattern
  </action>
  <verify>
- `commands/wp-block-review.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
- `commands/wp-block.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
- wp-block-review.md references `wp-block-development` skill by name
- wp-block-review.md mentions "Code Review Workflow" and "Output Format"
- wp-block-review.md suggests /wp-sec-review for security concerns AND /wp-plugin-review for plugin issues
- wp-block.md references "Search Patterns for Quick Detection" section
- wp-block.md mentions scanning both PHP and JS/JSX files
- wp-block.md suggests `/wp-block-review` for deeper analysis
- Both files follow the exact pattern of their security/plugin counterparts
  </verify>
  <done>
/wp-block-review command delegates to wp-block-development skill's full Code Review Workflow with security and plugin cross-references. /wp-block command delegates to Search Patterns for Quick Detection section for grep-based triage across both PHP and JS/JSX files. Both match the established slash command pattern from the security, plugin, and performance skills.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Both command files exist in `commands/` directory
- YAML frontmatter is valid in both files
- wp-block-review.md references the correct skill name and workflow
- wp-block.md references the correct grep patterns section
- Pattern matches existing wp-sec-review.md, wp-sec.md, wp-plugin-review.md, wp-plugin.md exactly (just different content)
- Security cross-reference present in wp-block-review.md
- Plugin architecture cross-reference present in wp-block-review.md
- Both PHP and JS/JSX file scanning mentioned in wp-block.md
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User can invoke /wp-block-review to trigger full block development review workflow
- User can invoke /wp-block to trigger quick grep-based block pattern check
- Commands are discoverable via Claude Code's slash command interface
- Commands delegate correctly to SKILL.md sections
- Security concerns route users to /wp-sec-review
- Plugin architecture concerns route users to /wp-plugin-review
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-gutenberg-blocks/03-03-SUMMARY.md`
