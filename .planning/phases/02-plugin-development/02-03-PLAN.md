<objective>
Create the two slash commands for the plugin development skill -- /wp-plugin-review (full review) and /wp-plugin (quick scan).

Purpose: Slash commands are the user-facing entry points. They delegate to the SKILL.md workflow (full review) or grep patterns (quick scan), matching the exact pattern established by the security and performance skills.

Output: 2 markdown files in `commands/` (~10-12 lines each).

  <name>Task 1: Create /wp-plugin-review and /wp-plugin slash commands</name>
  <files>
    commands/wp-plugin-review.md
    commands/wp-plugin.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create both slash command files by following the EXACT pattern of the existing security skill commands (`commands/wp-sec-review.md` and `commands/wp-sec.md`). These are simple delegation files.

**File 1: commands/wp-plugin-review.md (PLG-28)**

Mirror `commands/wp-sec-review.md` exactly, replacing security references with plugin development:

```markdown
---
description: WordPress plugin architecture review - validates plugin headers, lifecycle hooks, prefixing, CPT/taxonomies, Settings API, hooks, i18n, and WordPress.org Plugin Check compliance
argument-hint: [file-or-directory]
---

Use and follow the **wp-plugin-development** skill to perform a comprehensive WordPress plugin architecture review.

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use current working directory)

Execute the full Code Review Workflow from the skill, load reference files as needed for deeper analysis, and format output using the skill's Output Format section with severity levels (Critical/Warning/Info). If security concerns are found, suggest running `/wp-sec-review` for comprehensive security analysis.
```

**File 2: commands/wp-plugin.md (PLG-29)**

Mirror `commands/wp-sec.md` exactly, replacing security references with plugin development:

```markdown
---
description: Quick WordPress plugin standards check - fast pattern detection for plugin architecture issues
argument-hint: [path]
---

Use the **wp-plugin-development** skill to perform a quick plugin standards check.

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use current working directory)

Focus only on the "Search Patterns for Quick Detection" section -- run the grep commands to find plugin architecture issues fast. Report matches with file:line references and severity levels. Skip deep analysis.

If critical issues are found, suggest running `/wp-plugin-review` for comprehensive architecture review with fix recommendations.
```

**Key differences from security commands:**
- Description references plugin architecture instead of security vulnerabilities
- wp-plugin-review mentions suggesting /wp-sec-review for security concerns
- wp-plugin suggests /wp-plugin-review (not /wp-sec-review) for follow-up
- Otherwise identical structure and delegation pattern
  </action>
  <verify>
- `commands/wp-plugin-review.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
- `commands/wp-plugin.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
- wp-plugin-review.md references `wp-plugin-development` skill by name
- wp-plugin-review.md mentions "Code Review Workflow" and "Output Format"
- wp-plugin-review.md suggests /wp-sec-review for security concerns
- wp-plugin.md references "Search Patterns for Quick Detection" section
- wp-plugin.md suggests `/wp-plugin-review` for deeper analysis
- Both files follow the exact pattern of their security/performance counterparts
  </verify>
  <done>
/wp-plugin-review command delegates to wp-plugin-development skill's full Code Review Workflow with security cross-reference. /wp-plugin command delegates to Search Patterns for Quick Detection section for grep-based triage. Both match the established slash command pattern from the security and performance skills.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Both command files exist in `commands/` directory
- YAML frontmatter is valid in both files
- wp-plugin-review.md references the correct skill name and workflow
- wp-plugin.md references the correct grep patterns section
- Pattern matches existing wp-sec-review.md and wp-sec.md exactly (just different content)
- Security cross-reference present in wp-plugin-review.md
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User can invoke /wp-plugin-review to trigger full plugin architecture review workflow
- User can invoke /wp-plugin to trigger quick grep-based plugin standards check
- Commands are discoverable via Claude Code's slash command interface
- Commands delegate correctly to SKILL.md sections
- Security concerns route users to /wp-sec-review
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-plugin-development/02-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
