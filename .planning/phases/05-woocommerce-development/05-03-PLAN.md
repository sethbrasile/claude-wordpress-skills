<objective>
Create the two slash commands for the WooCommerce skill (/wp-woo-review, /wp-woo) and complete infrastructure updates (README.md, marketplace.json, plugin.json version bump, CHANGELOG.md) to finalize the plugin build-out.

Purpose: Slash commands are the user-facing entry points. Infrastructure updates complete the plugin to v2.0 with all 6 skills documented and registered. This is the final plan of the entire project.

Output: 2 command files in `commands/`, updated README.md, updated marketplace.json, bumped plugin.json, new/updated CHANGELOG.md.

  <name>Task 1: Create /wp-woo-review and /wp-woo slash commands</name>
  <files>
    commands/wp-woo-review.md
    commands/wp-woo.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create both slash command files by following the EXACT pattern of the existing block, plugin, theme, and security skill commands. These are simple delegation files.

**File 1: commands/wp-woo-review.md (WOO-29)**

Mirror the existing review commands exactly, replacing with WooCommerce content:

```markdown
---
description: WooCommerce development review - validates HPOS compatibility, payment gateway security, WooCommerce CRUD patterns, hook usage, template override quality, cart fragments performance, and Action Scheduler patterns for WC 8.2+
argument-hint: [file-or-directory]
---

Use and follow the **wp-woocommerce-dev** skill to perform a comprehensive WooCommerce development review.

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use current working directory)

Execute the full Code Review Workflow from the skill, starting with WooCommerce context detection (extension/theme integration/payment gateway/shipping method/custom product type/WC Blocks). Load reference files as needed for deeper analysis, and format output using the skill's Output Format section with severity levels (Critical/Warning/Info). If security concerns are found, suggest running `/wp-sec-review`. If plugin architecture issues are found, suggest running `/wp-plugin-review`. If block-related issues are found, suggest running `/wp-block-review`. If template/theme issues are found, suggest running `/wp-theme-review`. If performance issues are found, suggest running `/wp-perf-review`.
```

**File 2: commands/wp-woo.md (WOO-30)**

Mirror the existing quick scan commands exactly, replacing with WooCommerce content:

```markdown
---
description: Quick WooCommerce scan - fast pattern detection for HPOS compatibility issues, payment security anti-patterns, cart fragments loading, template override problems, and direct database access
argument-hint: [path]
---

Use the **wp-woocommerce-dev** skill to perform a quick WooCommerce check.

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use current working directory)

Focus only on the "Search Patterns for Quick Detection" section -- run the grep commands to find WooCommerce development issues fast. Report matches with file:line references and severity levels. Skip deep analysis.

If critical issues are found, suggest running `/wp-woo-review` for comprehensive WooCommerce review with fix recommendations.
```

**Key differences from prior commands:**
- Description references HPOS, payment gateway security, CRUD patterns, cart fragments, Action Scheduler
- wp-woo-review mentions WooCommerce context detection as first step (6 context types)
- wp-woo-review suggests all 5 other skills for cross-cutting concerns (most cross-referential command)
- wp-woo suggests /wp-woo-review for follow-up
- Otherwise identical structure and delegation pattern
  </action>
  <verify>
- `commands/wp-woo-review.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
- `commands/wp-woo.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
- wp-woo-review.md references `wp-woocommerce-dev` skill by name
- wp-woo-review.md mentions "Code Review Workflow" and "Output Format"
- wp-woo-review.md mentions WooCommerce context detection (extension/theme/gateway/shipping/product type/WC Blocks)
- wp-woo-review.md suggests all 5 other review commands for cross-cutting concerns
- wp-woo.md references "Search Patterns for Quick Detection" section
- wp-woo.md suggests `/wp-woo-review` for deeper analysis
- Both files follow the exact pattern of their block/plugin/security/theme counterparts
  </verify>
  <done>
/wp-woo-review command delegates to wp-woocommerce-dev skill's full Code Review Workflow with WooCommerce context detection and cross-references to all 5 other skills. /wp-woo command delegates to Search Patterns for Quick Detection section for grep-based triage. Both match the established slash command pattern.

  <name>Task 2: Update infrastructure files (README, marketplace, plugin version, CHANGELOG)</name>
  <files>
    README.md
    .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
    .claude-plugin/plugin.json
    CHANGELOG.md
  </files>
  <action>
Update all infrastructure files to reflect the complete plugin with all 6 skills. Read each file first before modifying.

**README.md (INF-01):**
Update the skill table to show all 6 skills with status checkmark. The table currently shows skills as in-progress. Update to:

| Skill | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **wp-performance-review** | Performance code review and optimization analysis | Done |
| **wp-security-review** | Security audit and vulnerability detection code review | Done |
| **wp-plugin-development** | Plugin architecture and WordPress.org standards review | Done |
| **wp-block-development** | Gutenberg block development and Block API patterns review | Done |
| **wp-theme-development** | Block theme development and FSE patterns review | Done |
| **wp-woocommerce-dev** | WooCommerce extension development and HPOS compatibility review | Done |

Add the WooCommerce skill's slash commands (/wp-woo-review, /wp-woo) to the commands documentation section following the same format as existing commands. Update the description at the top to include WooCommerce. Update any "5 skills" references to "6 skills". Update any mention of skills being "in progress" or "planned".

Note: Use the same status indicator format already in the README (checkmark or emoji format that exists).

**marketplace.json (INF-02):**
Update the description to include WooCommerce. The current description says "performance optimization, security auditing, Gutenberg block development, and theme/plugin best practices". Update to include WooCommerce development. Update the version to match plugin.json.

**plugin.json (INF-03):**
Bump version from "1.3.1" to "2.0.0" -- this represents the complete plugin with all 6 skills delivered (a major milestone). Update the description to include WooCommerce.

**CHANGELOG.md (INF-04):**
Read the existing file first. Add entries for all new skills added across phases 1-5. Format should follow existing changelog conventions (or create new if empty). Include:

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-06
