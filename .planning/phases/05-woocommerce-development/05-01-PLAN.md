<objective>
Create the main SKILL.md for wp-woocommerce-dev -- the core skill file that teaches Claude how to review WooCommerce extension and theme integration code for WooCommerce 8.2+ (HPOS default) through current 10.x.

Purpose: This is the primary deliverable of Phase 5 and the final skill in the plugin. It defines the complete WooCommerce review workflow covering HPOS compatibility, CRUD-based data access, payment gateway development, shipping methods, custom product types, WooCommerce hooks, order handling, cart operations, template overrides, cart fragments performance, Action Scheduler patterns, and webhook security. This skill is the most cross-referential -- touching security (payment), plugin (extension architecture), blocks (WC Blocks), themes (template overrides), and performance (cart fragments, queries).

Output: `skills/wp-woocommerce-dev/SKILL.md` (~900+ lines) with 12 sections mirroring the existing skill structure.

  <name>Task 1: Create SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter and 12-section structure</name>
  <files>skills/wp-woocommerce-dev/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Create `skills/wp-woocommerce-dev/SKILL.md` following the EXACT section structure of the existing `skills/wp-block-development/SKILL.md` (most recent comprehensive template) but with WooCommerce development content. Also reference `skills/wp-theme-development/SKILL.md`, `skills/wp-plugin-development/SKILL.md`, and `skills/wp-security-review/SKILL.md` for consistent formatting.

**IMPORTANT: This skill reviews PHP files for WooCommerce extensions, payment gateways, shipping methods, custom product types, and theme integration code. All examples follow WordPress PHP Coding Standards (spaces in parentheses, array() not [], Yoda conditions). This is the most cross-referential skill -- it touches all 5 prior skills.**

**YAML Frontmatter (WOO-01):**
- `name: wp-woocommerce-dev`
- `description:` Must include trigger phrases and fit within 1024 characters. Include: "WooCommerce review", "WooCommerce extension", "WooCommerce plugin", "payment gateway", "shipping method", "HPOS", "High-Performance Order Storage", "custom product type", "WC hooks", "cart fragments", "checkout block", "WooCommerce template", "wc_get_orders", "WC_Payment_Gateway", "woocommerce_checkout", "shop_order", "WooCommerce performance", "cart optimization", "WooCommerce REST API", "Action Scheduler", "WooCommerce blocks". Describe what the skill reviews (HPOS compatibility, CRUD patterns, payment gateways, shipping methods, custom product types, hooks, template overrides, cart fragments, Action Scheduler).

**12 Sections (mirror block/plugin/security/theme skill layout):**

1. **Overview** -- Systematic WooCommerce development review for WC 8.2+ through current 10.x. Core principle: WooCommerce has undergone a fundamental architectural shift -- HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage) is default for new stores since WC 8.2 (Oct 2023), requiring all extensions to use CRUD APIs exclusively. Direct post access for orders is broken on modern stores. CRUD-first data access (WC_Data, WC_Order, WC_Product), Action Scheduler for background processing, hooks-over-template-overrides for maintainability. Review validates HPOS compatibility, payment security (code-level only, NOT PCI compliance audit), hook usage, template override quality, and performance patterns. Auto-detects WooCommerce context type (extension, theme integration, payment gateway, shipping method, custom product type, WC Blocks integration) and adjusts guidance. Report with line numbers, severity, BAD/GOOD code pairs. Note: This is the most cross-referential skill, touching security, plugin architecture, blocks, themes, and performance.

2. **When to Use / Don't Use** -- Use for: WooCommerce extension architecture review, HPOS compatibility audit, payment gateway code review, shipping method review, custom product type review, WooCommerce hook usage analysis, template override assessment, cart fragments performance analysis, Action Scheduler pattern review, WooCommerce REST API extension review, WC Blocks integration check, webhook security review. Don't use for: generic plugin architecture (use wp-plugin-development), security-only audits (use wp-security-review), block development outside WC (use wp-block-development), theme-only review without WC integration (use wp-theme-development), performance-only review (use wp-performance-review), PCI compliance auditing (out of scope), store setup or hosting configuration.

3. **Code Review Workflow** -- 8-step workflow:
   1. Detect WooCommerce context from file structure:
      - Extension/plugin: Main plugin file with WC dependency check, HPOS declaration
      - Theme integration: woocommerce/ directory in theme with template overrides
      - Payment gateway: Class extending WC_Payment_Gateway
      - Shipping method: Class extending WC_Shipping_Method
      - Custom product type: Class extending WC_Product
      - WC Blocks integration: Checkout block extension points, Store API usage
   2. Check HPOS compatibility (WOO-16):
      - declare_compatibility() in before_woocommerce_init hook (CRITICAL if missing)
      - Scan for direct post access: get_posts/WP_Query with shop_order, get_post_meta/update_post_meta for orders, direct $wpdb queries against wp_posts for orders
      - Scan for proper CRUD: wc_get_order(), wc_get_orders(), WC_Order methods, ->save()
   3. Check data access patterns (WOO-02, WOO-17):
      - Product access: wc_get_product(), WC_Product_Query vs WP_Query with post_type=product
      - Order access: wc_get_order(), wc_get_orders() vs get_posts with shop_order
      - Direct DB queries against WC tables (CRITICAL)
   4. If payment gateway detected (WOO-03, WOO-19, WOO-20):
      - Check for raw card data storage/logging (CRITICAL)
      - Verify process_payment() flow returns correct array structure
      - Check HTTPS verification for production
      - Check for hardcoded API credentials (WARNING)
      - Verify webhook signature verification if applicable
      - Cross-reference wp-security-review for general security patterns
   5. Check WooCommerce hook usage (WOO-05, WOO-06, WOO-07, WOO-08):
      - Proper lifecycle hooks, product data hooks, checkout field hooks
      - Order status transition hooks
      - Cart operation hooks
   6. Check template overrides (WOO-10, WOO-11, WOO-12, WOO-13):
      - Template overrides with deleted action hooks (CRITICAL)
      - Outdated template versions (WARNING)
      - Template override where hook exists (INFO)
      - Cross-reference wp-theme-development for template patterns
   7. Check performance patterns (WOO-15, WOO-17, WOO-18):
      - Cart fragments site-wide loading (CRITICAL/WARNING)
      - wp_cron() for bulk WC operations (WARNING)
      - Session handling exceeding 30-day cap (WARNING)
      - Product query optimization
   8. Report using output format below. Suggest cross-referencing skills as appropriate.

   **Context Detection:** Auto-detect WooCommerce context FIRST, then apply appropriate review path. Payment gateways get heightened security review. Theme integrations get template override focus. Extensions get full HPOS + CRUD + hook audit.

4. **File-Type Specific Checks** -- Organized by WooCommerce concern:

   **HPOS Compatibility (WOO-16, deep coverage):**
   - CRITICAL: Missing declare_compatibility() call in before_woocommerce_init hook
   - CRITICAL: get_posts() or WP_Query with post_type='shop_order'
   - CRITICAL: get_post_meta()/update_post_meta() for order data
   - CRITICAL: Direct $wpdb queries against wp_posts/wp_postmeta for orders
   - WARNING: WP_Query with post_type='product' (future-breaking, custom product tables planned)
   - GOOD patterns: wc_get_order(), wc_get_orders(), $order->get_meta(), $order->update_meta_data(), $order->save()
   - Compatibility mode awareness: code should work in both HPOS and legacy modes

   **WooCommerce CRUD Pattern (WOO-02, WOO-07, deep coverage):**
   - WC_Data base class pattern
   - Data stores (WC_Object_Data_Store_Interface)
   - wc_get_products() / WC_Product_Query for products
   - wc_get_orders() for orders
   - WC_Order CRUD: get_meta(), update_meta_data(), save()
   - Custom data store registration via woocommerce_data_stores filter
   - Order status transitions: wc_get_order_statuses(), set_status(), custom statuses via register_post_status + wc_order_statuses filter
   - Order item manipulation, order notes

   **Payment Gateway Development (WOO-03, WOO-19, deep coverage):**
   - WC_Payment_Gateway class: constructor, init_form_fields(), init_settings(), process_payment()
   - process_payment() must return array with 'result' and 'redirect' keys
   - Refund handling: process_refund($order_id, $amount, $reason)
   - Saved payment methods: WC_Payment_Token API
   - CRITICAL: Never store/log raw card data (card numbers, CVV, expiry)
   - CRITICAL: Never log card data in error_log() or debug.log
   - WARNING: Hardcoded API credentials in code
   - WARNING: Missing is_ssl() check in production
   - Use payment_complete($transaction_id) not manual status change
   - Cross-reference wp-security-review for general security

   **Shipping Methods (WOO-04, deep coverage):**
   - WC_Shipping_Method class: constructor with instance_id, supports array, calculate_shipping()
   - Shipping zones, flat rate/free shipping customization
   - $this->add_rate() with id, label, cost, calc_tax

   **Custom Product Types (WOO-02, deep coverage):**
   - register_product_type() and extending WC_Product
   - Product data stores, product type class hierarchy
   - Custom product type registration via woocommerce_product_class filter

   **WooCommerce Hooks Catalog (WOO-05, WOO-06, deep coverage):**

   - Product data: woocommerce_product_options_*, woocommerce_process_product_meta
   - Checkout fields: woocommerce_checkout_fields, woocommerce_checkout_update_order_meta
   - Email: woocommerce_email_classes, woocommerce_order_status_{status}_notification
   - Cart: woocommerce_add_cart_item_data, woocommerce_cart_calculate_fees, woocommerce_check_cart_items

   **Cart Operations (WOO-08, deep coverage):**
   - WC()->cart methods: add_to_cart(), get_cart(), calculate_totals()
   - Cart item data via woocommerce_add_cart_item_data filter
   - Cart fees via woocommerce_cart_calculate_fees action
   - Cart validation via woocommerce_check_cart_items action

   **Cart Fragments Performance (WOO-15, deep coverage):**
   - Detect site-wide wc-cart-fragments.js loading (CRITICAL if no conditional)
   - Recommend Mini-Cart Block (built-in optimization) or conditional dequeuing
   - woocommerce_get_script_data filter for conditional loading
   - WARNING on non-WC pages without justification

   **Action Scheduler Patterns (deep coverage):**
   - Detect wp_cron() for heavy WC tasks (WARNING)
   - Recommend as_schedule_single_action(), as_enqueue_async_action()
   - Batch processing pattern for large datasets
   - Ships with WooCommerce, no separate installation

   **Webhook Security (deep coverage):**

   **Template Override Anti-Patterns (WOO-10, deep coverage):**
   - CRITICAL: Template overrides with deleted do_action() hooks
   - WARNING: Outdated template versions (@version mismatch)
   - INFO: Template override where hook exists (suggest hook instead)
   - Hooks-first philosophy as key teaching point
   - Cross-reference wp-theme-development for template patterns

   **Surface-level coverage (scan patterns + brief guidance):**
   - WooCommerce Blocks checkout integration (WOO-14): Store API, block checkout extension points, Additional Checkout Fields API (WC 8.6+), compatibility declarations
   - WooCommerce REST API extensions (WOO-09): v3 endpoints, custom endpoint registration, authentication (Basic Auth, OAuth 1.0a), HTTPS enforcement
   - Coupon/discount validation (WOO-21): woocommerce_coupon_is_valid filter, custom coupon types
   - Session handling (WOO-18): WC_Session_Handler, 30-day cap (WC 10.1+), avoid custom session implementations
   - Email customization: WC_Email class extension, template overrides for emails
   - Product variations performance: attribute lookup table, variation price caching (WC 10.5+)
   - WooCommerce Blocks compatibility: template overrides incompatible with block checkout, recommend block integration
   - Experimental product object caching (WC 10.5+): awareness only

   Each check item includes: pattern to find, severity level, brief explanation.

5. **Search Patterns for Quick Detection (WOO-22)** -- Bash grep commands organized by severity:

   CRITICAL:
   - Missing HPOS declaration (no declare_compatibility in PHP files)
   - get_posts/WP_Query with post_type shop_order
   - Direct $wpdb queries against wp_posts/wp_postmeta for order data
   - Raw card data storage/logging patterns (card_number, cvv in DB operations or error_log)
   - Template overrides without do_action() calls
   - Missing webhook signature verification

   WARNING:
   - WP_Query with post_type=product (future-breaking)
   - Site-wide cart-fragments loading without conditional dequeue
   - wp_cron()/wp_schedule_event for bulk WC operations
   - Hardcoded API credentials in payment code
   - Outdated template override versions
   - Session filters exceeding 30-day cap
   - get_post_meta/update_post_meta for order fields

   INFO:
   - Template overrides where hooks exist
   - Missing object caching for repeated product loads
   - Action Scheduler candidates (synchronous bulk processing)
   - WC Blocks integration opportunities

   Use comments to explain each grep. Note WC-specific patterns need different regex than generic WP. Handle false positives: get_posts() for non-order post types is valid, WP_Query for standard posts/pages is valid -- only flag when combined with WC-specific post types.

6. **WooCommerce Context Detection** -- Context-aware review notes:
   - **Extension/plugin**: Main plugin file with WC dependency check. Full HPOS + CRUD + hook audit. Most common context.
   - **Theme integration**: woocommerce/ directory with template overrides. Template override focus with hooks-first guidance. Cross-reference wp-theme-development.
   - **Payment gateway**: WC_Payment_Gateway subclass. Heightened security review (never store raw cards). HTTPS check. Webhook verification.
   - **Shipping method**: WC_Shipping_Method subclass. calculate_shipping() review, zone support, rate calculation.
   - **Custom product type**: WC_Product subclass. Data store review, product type registration, class hierarchy.
   - **WC Blocks integration**: Store API usage, checkout block extension points. Surface-level review, suggest wp-block-development for deep block patterns.

7. **Quick Reference: WooCommerce Development Patterns (WOO-23)** -- Organized by concern with BAD/GOOD code pairs. Cover ALL deep-coverage areas:
   - HPOS Compatibility Declaration -- declare_compatibility() in before_woocommerce_init hook
   - Order Data Access -- wc_get_order(), wc_get_orders() vs get_posts/WP_Query
   - Order Meta Operations -- $order->update_meta_data() + $order->save() vs update_post_meta()
   - Product Data Access -- wc_get_product(), WC_Product_Query vs WP_Query
   - Payment Gateway -- WC_Payment_Gateway class, process_payment() flow, security patterns
   - Shipping Method -- WC_Shipping_Method class, calculate_shipping()
   - Custom Product Type -- register_product_type(), extending WC_Product
   - Cart Operations -- WC()->cart methods, cart item data, cart fees
   - Order Status Transitions -- set_status(), payment_complete(), custom statuses
   - Template Override with Hook Preservation -- preserving all do_action() calls
   - Cart Fragments Optimization -- conditional dequeuing, Mini-Cart Block alternative
   - Action Scheduler -- as_enqueue_async_action() vs wp_cron()
   - Webhook Security -- HMAC-SHA256 verification with hash_equals()
   - WooCommerce Blocks Checkout -- Additional Checkout Fields API (WC 8.6+)

   Plus surface-level patterns:
   - REST API Extension -- custom endpoints, authentication
   - Coupon Validation -- woocommerce_coupon_is_valid filter
   - Session Handling -- 30-day cap awareness
   - Email Customization -- WC_Email extension

   ALL PHP code examples follow WordPress PHP Coding Standards.
   ALL code pairs use BAD/GOOD pattern.

8. **Severity Definitions (WOO-24)** -- Table matching all prior skill format:
   - CRITICAL: Extension will break on modern WC stores or has security vulnerabilities -- missing HPOS compatibility declaration, direct post access for orders, direct DB queries for orders/products, raw card data storage/logging, template overrides with deleted hooks, missing webhook signature verification, transmitting card data over HTTP
   - WARNING: Extension works but has quality/compatibility/performance issues -- WP_Query for products (future-breaking), cart fragments site-wide, outdated template overrides, hardcoded API credentials, wp_cron for bulk operations, session duration exceeding 30 days, get_post_meta/update_post_meta for order fields, missing HTTPS check in payment processing
   - INFO: Best practice improvements -- hooks instead of template overrides, Action Scheduler instead of wp_cron for light tasks, object caching for product loads, WC Blocks integration opportunity, Additional Checkout Fields API, product object caching (WC 10.5+)

9. **Output Format (WOO-24)** -- Match all prior skill format exactly:
   - Group findings by FILE (PHP files organized by actual file path)
   - Each finding: line number, severity, issue description, explanation, BAD/GOOD code pair with fix
   - Summary at end with total counts by severity
   - If security concerns found: "Security issues detected. Run `/wp-sec-review` for comprehensive security analysis."
   - If plugin architecture issues found: "Plugin architecture issues detected. Run `/wp-plugin-review` for comprehensive plugin review."
   - If block-related issues found: "Block development issues detected. Run `/wp-block-review` for comprehensive block review."
   - If template/theme issues found: "Theme issues detected. Run `/wp-theme-review` for comprehensive theme review."
   - If performance issues found: "Performance issues detected. Run `/wp-perf-review` for comprehensive performance analysis."

10. **Common Mistakes (WOO-25)** -- Table of WooCommerce-specific false positives:
    - get_posts() for custom post types that are NOT orders/products is valid
    - WP_Query for standard posts/pages within WC extensions is valid
    - get_post_meta() for custom post types that are NOT orders is valid
    - Template overrides in child themes are legitimate when hooks are preserved
    - wc-cart-fragments.js on cart/checkout/product pages is expected
    - wp_cron() for lightweight non-WC tasks is acceptable
    - WC_Session usage within 30-day window is normal
    - error_log() in non-payment code is acceptable
    - Direct $wpdb for custom tables (NOT WC core tables) is valid
    - process_payment() accessing $_POST for custom gateway fields (not card data) is valid
    - Template overrides without @version comment are just missing metadata, not necessarily outdated
    Add more from RESEARCH.md common pitfalls.

11. **Version Compatibility Reference** -- Quick reference for WC version requirements:
    - WC 3.0+: CRUD API (WC_Data, wc_get_order, wc_get_product)
    - WC 6.3+: Product attribute lookup table
    - WC 7.8+: Cart fragments no longer global by default
    - WC 8.2+: HPOS default for new stores, declare_compatibility required
    - WC 8.6+: Additional Checkout Fields API for block checkout
    - WC 10.1+: Session 30-day cap enforced
    - WC 10.4+: wc_enqueue_js() deprecated, use wp_add_inline_script()
    - WC 10.5+: Product object caching (experimental), variation price caching improvements

12. **Deep-Dive References** -- Table linking to companion reference docs:
    | Task | Reference to Load |
    |------|-------------------|
    | HPOS compatibility, payment gateways, shipping methods, custom product types, order/cart operations, REST API, Action Scheduler, webhook security | `references/wc-extension-guide.md` |
    | Template hierarchy, override procedures, hooks-first philosophy, shop/product/cart/checkout theming, email templates | `references/wc-template-guide.md` |
    | Cart fragments analysis, WC_Product_Query optimization, HPOS performance, session handling, Action Scheduler background processing, caching strategies | `references/wc-performance-guide.md` |

**Content sourcing:** Use 05-RESEARCH.md extensively -- it has verified code examples, architecture patterns, and pitfalls. Adapt and organize into SKILL.md sections. The SKILL.md should be concise and actionable, with reference docs handling deep dives.

**Critical constraint:** The SKILL.md must be SELF-SUFFICIENT for a standard WooCommerce review. Reference docs add depth but are not required for basic reviews.

**Security crossover (LOCKED DECISION):** Do NOT duplicate security patterns. When encountering security-relevant patterns (payment data handling, REST API authentication, AJAX nonce verification), include a brief reminder and add: "See wp-security-review skill for detailed security analysis" or suggest /wp-sec-review.

**Plugin crossover (LOCKED DECISION):** Do NOT duplicate plugin architecture patterns. When encountering plugin-level patterns (WC dependency checking, hooks architecture, activation/deactivation), include brief mention and add: "See wp-plugin-development skill for plugin architecture depth" or suggest /wp-plugin-review.

**Block crossover (LOCKED DECISION):** Do NOT duplicate block development patterns. When encountering WooCommerce Blocks integration, include brief mention and add: "See wp-block-development skill for block development depth" or suggest /wp-block-review.

**Theme crossover (LOCKED DECISION):** Do NOT duplicate theme development patterns. When encountering template overrides in themes, include brief mention and add: "See wp-theme-development skill for theme development depth" or suggest /wp-theme-review.

**Performance crossover (LOCKED DECISION):** Do NOT duplicate general performance patterns. When encountering cart fragments, query optimization, caching, include brief mention and add: "See wp-performance-review skill for comprehensive performance analysis" or suggest /wp-perf-review.
