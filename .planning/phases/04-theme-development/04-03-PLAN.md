<objective>
Create the two slash commands for the theme development skill -- /wp-theme-review (full review) and /wp-theme (quick scan).

Purpose: Slash commands are the user-facing entry points. They delegate to the SKILL.md workflow (full review) or grep patterns (quick scan), matching the exact pattern established by the security, performance, plugin, and block skills.

Output: 2 markdown files in `commands/` (~10-15 lines each).

  <name>Task 1: Create /wp-theme-review and /wp-theme slash commands</name>
  <files>
    commands/wp-theme-review.md
    commands/wp-theme.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create both slash command files by following the EXACT pattern of the existing block and plugin skill commands (`commands/wp-block-review.md`, `commands/wp-block.md`, `commands/wp-plugin-review.md`, `commands/wp-plugin.md`). These are simple delegation files.

**File 1: commands/wp-theme-review.md (THM-28)**

Mirror the existing review commands exactly, replacing with theme development content:

```markdown
---
description: WordPress theme development review - validates theme.json v3 structure, block theme templates, template parts, global styles, style variations, block patterns, and classic-to-block migration opportunities for WP 6.6+
argument-hint: [file-or-directory]
---

Use and follow the **wp-theme-development** skill to perform a comprehensive WordPress theme development review.

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use current working directory)

Execute the full Code Review Workflow from the skill, starting with theme type detection (block/classic/hybrid/child). Load reference files as needed for deeper analysis, and format output using the skill's Output Format section with severity levels (Critical/Warning/Info). Review PHP, HTML template, and JSON files. If security concerns are found, suggest running `/wp-sec-review`. If plugin architecture issues are found, suggest running `/wp-plugin-review`. If block markup issues are found, suggest running `/wp-block-review`.
```

**File 2: commands/wp-theme.md (THM-29)**

Mirror the existing quick scan commands exactly, replacing with theme development content:

```markdown
---
description: Quick WordPress theme scan - fast pattern detection for theme.json issues, missing required files, hardcoded styles, and template hierarchy problems across PHP, HTML, and JSON files
argument-hint: [path]
---

Use the **wp-theme-development** skill to perform a quick theme check.

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use current working directory)

Focus only on the "Search Patterns for Quick Detection" section -- run the grep commands to find theme development issues fast across PHP, HTML template, and JSON files. Report matches with file:line references and severity levels. Skip deep analysis.

If critical issues are found, suggest running `/wp-theme-review` for comprehensive theme review with fix recommendations.
```

**Key differences from block/plugin/security commands:**
- Description references theme.json, block theme templates, template parts, global styles, style variations, classic-to-block migration
- wp-theme-review mentions theme type detection (block/classic/hybrid/child) as first step
- wp-theme-review mentions suggesting /wp-sec-review, /wp-plugin-review, AND /wp-block-review for cross-cutting concerns (first command to reference three other skills)
- wp-theme mentions scanning PHP, HTML template, and JSON files (three file types)
- wp-theme suggests /wp-theme-review (not other skills) for follow-up
- Otherwise identical structure and delegation pattern
  </action>
  <verify>
- `commands/wp-theme-review.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
- `commands/wp-theme.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint)
- wp-theme-review.md references `wp-theme-development` skill by name
- wp-theme-review.md mentions "Code Review Workflow" and "Output Format"
- wp-theme-review.md mentions theme type detection (block/classic/hybrid/child)
- wp-theme-review.md suggests /wp-sec-review for security concerns, /wp-plugin-review for plugin issues, AND /wp-block-review for block markup issues
- wp-theme.md references "Search Patterns for Quick Detection" section
- wp-theme.md mentions scanning PHP, HTML template, and JSON files
- wp-theme.md suggests `/wp-theme-review` for deeper analysis
- Both files follow the exact pattern of their block/plugin/security counterparts
  </verify>
  <done>
/wp-theme-review command delegates to wp-theme-development skill's full Code Review Workflow with theme type detection and security/plugin/block cross-references. /wp-theme command delegates to Search Patterns for Quick Detection section for grep-based triage across PHP, HTML template, and JSON files. Both match the established slash command pattern from the security, plugin, block, and performance skills.

<verification>
- Both command files exist in `commands/` directory
- YAML frontmatter is valid in both files
- wp-theme-review.md references the correct skill name and workflow
- wp-theme.md references the correct grep patterns section
- Pattern matches existing wp-block-review.md, wp-block.md, wp-plugin-review.md, wp-plugin.md exactly (just different content)
- Security cross-reference present in wp-theme-review.md
- Plugin architecture cross-reference present in wp-theme-review.md
- Block development cross-reference present in wp-theme-review.md
- PHP, HTML template, and JSON file scanning mentioned in wp-theme.md
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User can invoke /wp-theme-review to trigger full theme development review workflow
- User can invoke /wp-theme to trigger quick grep-based theme pattern check
- Commands are discoverable via Claude Code's slash command interface
- Commands delegate correctly to SKILL.md sections
- Security concerns route users to /wp-sec-review
- Plugin architecture concerns route users to /wp-plugin-review
- Block markup concerns route users to /wp-block-review
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-theme-development/04-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
