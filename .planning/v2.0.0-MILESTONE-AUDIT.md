### Infrastructure

| File | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| .claude-plugin/plugin.json | Updated | Version 2.0.0 |
| .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | Updated | Version 2.0.0, all skills registered |

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Wiring Verification

| Source Skill | Referenced By | Links Verified |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| wp-security-review | plugin, block, theme, WooCommerce | 20+ references |
| wp-plugin-development | block, theme, WooCommerce | 10+ references |
| wp-block-development | theme, WooCommerce | 8+ references |
| wp-theme-development | WooCommerce | 6+ references |
| wp-performance-review | WooCommerce | 3+ references |

Total cross-references: 70+ verified links across all skills.

All references are:
- Contextually appropriate (security referenced for payment patterns, not generically)
- Bidirectional where applicable (skills reference each other)
- Include actionable escalation paths (e.g., "run /wp-sec-review for deeper analysis")

### E2E User Flows

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| A | New user discovery: README → skill table → command invocation | PASSED |
| B | Cross-skill escalation: /wp-sec-review → /wp-plugin-review → /wp-block-review | PASSED |
| C | WooCommerce full integration: /wp-woo-review cross-referencing all 5 skills | PASSED |
| D | Quick-to-deep escalation: /wp-perf → /wp-perf-review → /wp-sec-review | PASSED |

### Consistency Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| YAML frontmatter valid | PASSED | All 6 skills have name + description |
| Description under 1024 chars | PASSED | Range: 578-889 characters |
| Severity labels consistent | PASSED | CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO used uniformly |
| BAD/GOOD code patterns | PASSED | All skills use consistent pattern |
| WordPress PHP Coding Standards | PASSED | array(), spaces in parens, Yoda conditions |

## Tech Debt

**None identified.** All phases completed without deferred items.

## Deferred to v2

These items were explicitly scoped out of v1 and tracked in REQUIREMENTS.md:

| ID | Description | Reason |
|----|-------------|--------|
| SEC-V2-01 | Magic method exploit detection | Advanced security, future enhancement |
| SEC-V2-02 | Security header generation | Infrastructure concern, out of code-review scope |
| BLK-V2-01 | Block Slots API patterns | API not yet standardized |
| BLK-V2-02 | Block library performance profiling | Specialized tooling, future enhancement |
| MS-01 | Multisite-specific patterns | Niche use case |
| MS-02 | Network-wide plugin activation | Niche use case |

These are tracked backlog items, not debt from incomplete v1 work.

## Audit Conclusion

The v2.0.0 milestone has achieved its definition of done:

1. **All 5 planned skills built** — each matching wp-performance-review quality bar
2. **150/150 requirements satisfied** — zero gaps
3. **15/15 plans executed** — all verified
4. **Cross-phase integration verified** — 70+ cross-references, 4/4 E2E flows
5. **Infrastructure updated** — version bumped, README/CHANGELOG/marketplace updated
6. **No tech debt** — clean completion

**Recommendation:** Ready for `/gsd:complete-milestone` to archive and tag.
