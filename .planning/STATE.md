## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Code-level security only (no server hardening) — keeps skill focused on what Claude can review
- Full-stack Gutenberg coverage (PHP + React/JSX) — WP 6.x+ block development requires both patterns
- Same slash command pattern per skill (full + quick) — consistent UX proven by performance skill
- All 5 skills at same depth — consistent quality, no half-built skills
- WP 6.x+ target only — modern APIs without legacy compatibility burden
- Dependency-driven build order — Security → Plugin → Gutenberg → Theme → WooCommerce
