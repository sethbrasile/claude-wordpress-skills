Use and follow the **wp-block-development** skill to perform a comprehensive WordPress block development review.

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use current working directory)

Execute the full Code Review Workflow from the skill, load reference files as needed for deeper analysis, and format output using the skill's Output Format section with severity levels (Critical/Warning/Info). Review both PHP and JavaScript/JSX files. If security concerns are found, suggest running `/wp-sec-review`. If plugin architecture issues are found, suggest running `/wp-plugin-review`.
